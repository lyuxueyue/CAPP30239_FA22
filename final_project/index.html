        <h3>What are renewable sources?</h3>
        <p> <i>In general, renewable sources include solar power, wind, hydro-electric, geothermal and biofuel.
            In the technical definition,"renewable" is any energy collected from resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. 
            In the popular definition "renewable" is equated with "sustainable" and "eco-friendly". </i>
        </p>
        <h3>Why pay attention to non-hydro electricity?</h3>
        <p> 
            <i>Hydroelectric power is an old renewable source. There are barely new hydroelectric dams that could be installed on earth now. 
            Therefore, we add the variable of non-hydro to show the development from other renewable electricity source.</i>

    <h2>Electricity Generation and Consumption in Selected Countries in the Past 5 Years</h2>
    <section class="section-container wrap-layout">
        <p>
            <b>Renewable</b> electricity generation in <b>Belgium</b> and <b>Turkey</b> have <b>stepped down</b> in 2021. Nearly <b>20%</b> of the countries have less renewable electricity generation compared with 2019, and another <b>20%</b> make no progress in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Zambia</b>, the only developing country that relies on renewable sources for more than <mark style="background: #8dd3c7"><b>85%</b> </mark>of its electricity. The ratio even gets <b>higher</b> after 2020.
        </p> 
        <p>
            We also see a slight <b>increase</b> in renewable electricity in <b>China</b> and <b>Mexico</b>, though relatively smaller than increase in the total generation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping a steady electricity generation and consumption, <b>New Zealand</b> has a substantially <b>higher</b> proportion of renewable electricity, <mark style="background: #8dd3c7"><b>87.5%</b></mark>, 
       
            compared with <b>Argentina</b> and <b>the U.S</b>.

	<section class="section-container">
        <p>
            The electricity generation and consumption situations differ greatly among countries.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>The <b>larger</b> the ratio is, the <b>smaller</b> proportion of renewable generation in total electricity consumption.</i>
